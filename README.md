# Overview

:construction: **Under Construction** :construction:

"Para-Graph" is a library for high-performance, parallel graph algorithms, optimized for both CPU and GPU.
The library is implemented in Rust and C++ and uses OpenACC for GPU acceleration.

Currently, the library is on the early stages of development and only a few algorithms are implemented. Expect bugs, incomplete features and breaking changes. Use at your own risk.
